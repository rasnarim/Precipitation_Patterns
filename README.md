# Precipitation_Patterns

## Project Overview

This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook focused on analyzing and visualizing precipitation patterns. The project applies various data science techniques to explore patterns, trends, and anomalies in precipitation data, potentially including time series analysis, geographical data processing, and data visualization.

## Notebook Description
The [Precipitation_Patterns.ipynb](Precipitation_Patterns.ipynb) notebook provides an in-depth analysis of precipitation patterns. The notebook covers several key aspects of data science and meteorological analysis:

1. **Data Collection**: Details on how the precipitation data is sourced and its initial characteristics.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Procedures for preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values, anomalies, and data transformation.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual and statistical methods to explore the data and uncover underlying patterns or trends.
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Examination of precipitation data over time to identify seasonal patterns, trends, and other temporal dynamics.
5. **Geographical Data Analysis**: If applicable, analysis of spatial patterns in precipitation, including mapping and spatial statistics.
6. **Conclusion and Insights**: Summarizing key findings and suggesting potential practical applications or areas for further research.

## Installation and Usage
To interact with the notebook, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rasnarim/Precipitation_Patterns.git
